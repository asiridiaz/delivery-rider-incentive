# Delivery Rider Incentive Processing Microservice Project

## Project Overview

I successfully completed a project for a leading food delivery service in Sri Lanka, focusing on automating the incentive distribution process for delivery riders. This microservice project aimed to enhance transparency, efficiency, and accuracy in the incentive management system, ensuring a fair and streamlined process for riders.

## Key Achievements

- **Automated Incentive Calculation**: Developed a PHP microservice to automate the calculation of trip incentives based on distance traveled, trip duration, and service type.
- **Enhanced Transparency and Accountability**: Implemented a system that generates detailed reports and sends them via email to relevent stake holders, providing a transparent and accountable way to manage incentive distribution.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Streamlined the incentive distribution process, reducing manual errors and improving overall efficiency.

## Technical Highlights

- **Architecture**: Built using PHP with MySQL for database interactions, following a procedural programming approach.
- **Database Connection and Data Fetching**: Established a secure connection to the database and constructed SQL queries to fetch relevant ride data.
- **Incentive Calculation**: Processed data to calculate incentives.
- **Credit the Calculated amount into the riders profile account**: Credit the incentive to the riders Profile accounts via calling nessecery APIs
- **Report Generation**: Generated detailed reports with calclulated incevtive values and transaction statuses with rider metadata.
- **Email Notification System**: Implemented an email notification system to send processed data as attachments, ensuring transparency and accountability.

## Deployment and Maintenance

The microservice was deployed on a server with PHP and MySQL installed. It was scheduled to run at specific intervals using a cron job, ensuring regular processing of incentives. Regular maintenance and updates were conducted to ensure the system's reliability and performance.

## Security and Compliance

Implemented basic security measures, including setting the maximum execution time and using prepared statements for database queries to mitigate SQL injection risks. Recommended additional security measures, such as encrypting sensitive data and implementing proper error handling and logging, to ensure the security and compliance of the system.

## Monitoring and Logging

Incorporated logging functionality to track the execution of the script and the processing of each transaction, crucial for debugging and monitoring the performance of the microservice. Regular monitoring ensured the system's reliability and performance.

## Conclusion

This project represented a significant contribution to the food delivery service, enhancing the incentive distribution process for delivery riders. By leveraging modern technologies and best practices, I aimed to improve transparency, efficiency, and security in the incentive management system. This experience showcases my ability to develop and deploy efficient, secure, and user-friendly solutions for complex business processes.
